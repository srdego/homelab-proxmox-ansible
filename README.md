# 📚 Homelab Proxmox Ansible

Ansible playbooks for post-install, hardening and maintenance of a Proxmox VE homelab.

Tailored for single-node, non-HA, non-subscription and non-enterprise hardware setups.
The playbooks streamline initial configuration, enhance security, and ensure smooth
upgrades and maintenance.

## ✅ Requirements

- Proxmox VE `9.x` host reachable via SSH.
- Control node with Ansible `2.20+` and access to the SSH public key declared in
  `ssh_pub_key_path`.
- `sudo` privileges on the target host.

## 📦 Variables

Defaults live in each role under `defaults/main.yaml`; override from inventory,
group vars, or host vars when tinkering.

## 🌀 Handlers

- `Restart systemd-journald` – triggered when journald storage is changed.
- `Restart sshd` – async restart to apply hardened settings without hanging the run.

## 🧪 Usage

No need to provide inventory as it's picked up from `ansible.cfg` by default.

```bash
# Full configuration
ansible-playbook playbooks/main.yaml

# Run an upgrade lifecycle only
ansible-playbook playbooks/upgrade.yaml
```

Inventory Snippet.

```ini
[proxmox]
bm-01 ansible_host=<your-host-ip>

[proxmox:vars]
ansible_user=root
ansible_python_interpreter=/usr/bin/python3
```
